Code for the Alexa Skill - Coronavirus Cases

I have used the HelloWorld Skill Template for creating this skill.

I have uploaded an index.js file which basically has all the code that performs the functionality of the program. It's a web scraping program which scrapes data form the Coronavirus Worldometer website and reports that data. Do have a look at my code and suggest any improvements. I am not an advanced programmer in Javascript or Node.js but am learning.

Things I need to work on:
1) Making the code more space and time efficient by using a for loop for getting each country's data.
2) Implementing APL(Alexa Presentation Language) to present the data in a more interactable and visually appealing way.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to view my project.
