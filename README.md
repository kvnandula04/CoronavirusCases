Code for the Alexa Skill - Coronavirus Cases

I have uploaded an index.js file which basically has all the code that performs the functionality of the program. It's a web scraping program which scrapes data form the Coronavirus Worldometer website and reports that data. Do have a look at my inefficient code and suggest any improvements. I am not so advanced in Javascript or Node.js so I would appreciate help.

Things I need to work on:
1) Making the code more space and time efficient by using a for loop.
2) Combining the LaunchIntent and the HelloWorldIntent together.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to view my code. And the README.
